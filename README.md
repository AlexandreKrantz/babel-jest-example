- did the webpack cli setup: `npx webpack-cli init` (webpack cli installed globally).
- installed the babel cli locally and created an npm script `babel-build` to do just the transpilation without minification.
- installed jest locally.
- To transpile es6 `import` statements to nodejs `require()` statements, `"modules": "cjs"` is specified in `.babelrc`
- To set up Jest debugging I followed this these instructions: https://github.com/jherax/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging-jest-tests
